# 🔍 How to See the PayU Tab

## Where to Find It

1. **Go to your frontend** → Click on any content with a price (marked as "Preview" 🔒)
2. **Click the "Preview" badge/button** → Payment Modal opens
3. **Look for TWO tabs at the top:**
   - UPI (default - shows QR code)
   - PayU (new - shows payment button)

## If You Don't See the PayU Tab

### Reason 1: Backend Settings Not Updated
The payment settings need to have `payuEnabled: true`. Let's update it:

**Option A: Via MongoDB (Recommended for now)**
```bash
# Connect to your MongoDB
# Find the PaymentSettings collection
# Update the document to add:
{
  "payuEnabled": true,
  "isActive": true
}

# OR update existing one:
db.paymentsettings.updateOne(
  {},
  { $set: { "payuEnabled": true } }
)
```

**Option B: Via API Call (after backend is running)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/payment-settings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "upiId": "your-upi-id@bank",
    "qrCodeUrl": "your-qr-url",
    "merchantName": "Your Store",
    "isActive": true,
    "payuEnabled": true
  }'
```

### Reason 2: Frontend Not Reloaded
- **Hard refresh** your browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or clear cache and reload

### Reason 3: Backend Not Restarted
- Stop your backend server
- Make sure `.env` changes are saved
- Start backend again

## Quick Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Backend is Serving PayU Routes
```bash
# In backend logs, you should see:
# 🔐 PayU Configuration:
#   Merchant Key: ❌ Not set (this is OK for now - will be set in .env)
#   Merchant Salt: ❌ Not set
#   Environment: test
#   Gateway URL: https://sandboxsecure.payu.in/_payment
```

### Step 2: Check Payment Settings
```bash
# Call this endpoint:
curl http://localhost:5000/api/payment-settings

# Should return something like:
{
  "_id": "...",
  "upiId": "...",
  "qrCodeUrl": "...",
  "merchantName": "...",
  "isActive": true,
  "payuEnabled": true,  ← Should be true
  "createdAt": "...",
  "updatedAt": "..."
}
```

### Step 3: Check Frontend Console
1. Open **DevTools** (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Click on a paid content to trigger modal
4. You should see logs like:
```
💳 PaymentModal rendered for content: ...
💳 Fetching payment settings...
💳 Payment settings loaded: {payuEnabled: true, ...}
```

## Testing the PayU Tab

Once you see the tab:

1. **Click the PayU tab** → Button changes color (blue)
2. **You'll see:** "Pay with PayU" button with credit card icon
3. **Click the button** → (Won't work yet without credentials, but should try to call backend)

## Environment Setup for Full Testing

Create/Update `.env` file:
```env
PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY=your_key_from_payu_dashboard
PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT=your_salt_from_payu_dashboard
PAYU_ENVIRONMENT=test

BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Then:
1. Restart backend
2. Hard refresh frontend
3. Test PayU payment flow

## Still Not Showing?

Check these in order:

```bash
# 1. Frontend compiled without errors?
cd frontend
npm run build

# 2. Backend PayU routes loaded?
grep -r "payuRoutes" backend/server.cjs

# 3. Payment settings schema updated?
grep -r "payuEnabled" backend/routes/paymentSettingsRoutes.cjs

# 4. Frontend has latest PaymentModal?
grep -r "paymentMethod === 'payU'" frontend/src/components/common/PaymentModal.tsx
```

## Architecture

```
Frontend (PaymentModal.tsx)
        ↓
    Fetches /api/payment-settings
        ↓
If payuEnabled === true → Show UPI + PayU tabs
        ↓
    Click "Pay with PayU"
        ↓
    Calls /api/payu/initiate
        ↓
Backend generates PayU form
        ↓
Frontend submits form → Redirects to PayU gateway
```

Let me know if you still don't see it! I can debug further! 🚀
