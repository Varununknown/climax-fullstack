**Commit:** 133627b  
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Video Not Pausing at Climax
**Problem:** 
- Video kept playing in background after modal appeared
- User could hear audio continuing past climax
- `video.pause()` was being called but not enforced

**Root Cause:**
- `handleTimeUpdate` was calling `video.pause()` but the listener was still firing
- No hard enforcement of the paused state

**Solution Implemented:**
```tsx
// BEFORE (Weak pause)
if (!hasPaid && time >= climax) {
  video.pause(); // Called but not enforced
  setShowPaymentModal(true);
}

// AFTER (Strong pause enforcement)
if (time >= climax) {
  console.log(`🔒 HARD LOCK: Entered locked zone`);
  
  // FORCE pause
  video.pause();
  setIsPlaying(false);
  
  // FORCE rewind
  video.currentTime = lastValidTime.current;
  
  // HARD STOP - return immediately
  return;
}
```

**Result:** Video now HARD STOPS at climax, no audio continues ✅

---

### Issue 2: Locked Zone Not Strong (Can Continue Past Climax)
**Problem:**
- After canceling payment modal, video continued playing past climax
- Locked zone was bypassed if user closed modal
- No enforcement that video must stay paused without payment

**Root Cause:**
- Modal close (`onClose`) just closed modal without checking payment status
- Video could be resumed by user clicking play
- No state to track "is video locked due to payment needed"

**Solution Implemented:**
```tsx
// Modal close now keeps video PAUSED
onClose={() => {
  console.log('🔒 Payment modal closed - keeping video paused');
  setShowPaymentModal(false);
  
  // FORCE video to stay paused
  if (videoRef.current) {
    videoRef.current.pause();
    setIsPlaying(false);
  }
}}
```

**Result:** Even if user closes modal, video stays locked and paused ✅

---

### Issue 3: Payment API 404 Error
**Problem:**
- Frontend calling `/payments` endpoint
- Backend has `/api/payments` endpoint
- Getting 404 error + "Unexpected token '<'" (HTML error page)

**Root Cause:**
```tsx
// BEFORE (Wrong endpoint)
const response = await fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/payments`, {
  // ...
});
// GET: https://climax-fullstack.onrender.com/payments (404)
// Returns HTML error page instead of JSON
// Parsing HTML as JSON = SyntaxError
```

**Solution Implemented:**
```tsx
// AFTER (Correct endpoint)
const paymentUrl = `${BACKEND_URL}/api/payments`;
console.log('📍 Sending to:', paymentUrl);
// GET: https://climax-fullstack.onrender.com/api/payments (200)

// Better error handling for non-JSON responses
if (!response.ok) {
  const text = await response.text();
  console.error('❌ Response not OK:', response.status, text);
  throw new Error(`Payment API error: ${response.status}`);
}

const result = await response.json();
```

**Result:** Payment now submits successfully without 404 ✅

---

### Issue 4: Modal Can Be Closed While Waiting
**Problem:**
- User could close payment modal while payment is processing
- No protection against interrupting payment submission

**Root Cause:**
- Close button (X) always available, even during payment submission

**Solution Implemented:**
```tsx
// Close button now disabled during 'waiting' state
{paymentStep !== 'waiting' && (
  <button 
    onClick={() => {
      // Warn user before closing
      const confirmed = window.confirm(
        'Are you sure? You cannot continue watching without payment.'
      );
      if (confirmed) {
        onClose();
      }
    }} 
    className="absolute right-4 top-4 text-gray-400 hover:text-white"
  >
    <X className="w-6 h-6" />
  </button>
)}
```

**Result:** User warned before closing, can't interrupt payment ✅

2. **Hardened seeking listener**
   - Added `if (hasPaid) return` at start
   - FORCE pause on seek attempt into locked zone

3. **Enhanced onClose handler**
