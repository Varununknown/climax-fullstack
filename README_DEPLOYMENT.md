## 🎯 MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT - VideoPlayer Refactoring

### ⭐ COMMIT: 7470528
**"REFACTOR: Complete VideoPlayer rewrite - simplify payment logic with proven climax-lock approach"**

### Changes Made
- ❌ Removed: 982 lines of complex logic (PaymentState, caching, verification loops)
- ✅ Added: 250 lines of proven simple logic (direct payment check, climax-lock, seek protection)
- ✨ Result: Cleaner, faster, more maintainable code
- 🎮 UI/Controls: 100% preserved (no breaking changes)

### Key Features
```
✅ Simple Payment State
   const [hasPaid, setHasPaid] = useState<boolean | null>(null)

✅ Direct Payment Verification
   GET /api/payments/check?userId=...&contentId=...

✅ Climax Lock Protection
   if (!hasPaid && time >= climax) → pause + show modal

✅ Seek Protection
   if (!hasPaid && seekTime >= climax) → prevent seek

✅ Auto Resume After Payment
   Payment verified → video resumes automatically
```

---

## 💳 PAYMENT FLOW (WORKING)

```
1. User clicks video
   ↓
2. System checks: GET /payments/check?userId=...&contentId=...
   ├─ If paid → Video plays fully
   └─ If unpaid → Climax protection enabled
   ↓
3. Video plays until climaxTimestamp
   ↓
4. At climax → Video pauses + "💳 Unlock" button shows
   ↓
5. User clicks Unlock → PaymentModal opens
   ↓
6. User enters card details → POST /api/payments
   ↓
7. Backend auto-approves (sandbox mode)
   ↓
8. Frontend re-verifies payment
   ↓
9. Video resumes automatically + seek enabled
```
