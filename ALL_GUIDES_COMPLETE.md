## 💡 Pro Tips

✅ Start with `README_PAYU_GUIDES.md` - it guides you to the right file

✅ Copy values EXACTLY as shown - no spaces, no quotes

✅ Restart backend after changing .env - values won't load otherwise

✅ Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) - clear cached values

✅ Check backend console for error messages - detailed logs help

✅ Test with sandbox first - free, no real money

✅ Keep your Merchant Salt secret - like a password

---

## 🔑 Key Information You'll Need

### From PayU (After Sign Up)
```
PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY = Your merchant ID
PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT = Your secret password
```

### Test Card (Always Works)
```
Card: 5123456789012346
Expiry: 05/25
CVV: 123
```
