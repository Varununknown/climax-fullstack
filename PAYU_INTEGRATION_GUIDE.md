# PayU Integration - Setup & Configuration Guide

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Frontend (PaymentModal.tsx)
- ✅ Fixed JSX syntax error from incomplete PayU implementation
- ✅ Added payment method selector (UPI vs PayU tabs)
- ✅ Implemented `handlePayUPayment()` function for PayU gateway redirect
- ✅ Added PayU section UI with gradient styling and loading states
- ✅ Tab system shows UPI or PayU payment form conditionally
- ✅ All responsive layout maintained (portrait/landscape)
- ✅ Compiled without errors - Ready for deployment

### Backend
- ✅ Created `payuRoutes.cjs` with full PayU integration:
  - POST `/api/payu/initiate` - Starts PayU payment
  - POST `/api/payu/success` - Handles successful payments
  - POST `/api/payu/failure` - Handles failed payments
  - GET `/api/payu/check/:txnid` - Checks payment status
- ✅ Integrated with Payment model
- ✅ Added `paymentMethod` and `payuTransactionId` fields to Payment schema
- ✅ Hash generation and verification using SHA512
- ✅ Mounted PayU routes on both servers (root and backend submodule)
- ✅ All routes properly integrated

## ⏳ What Needs Configuration

### 1. **Environment Variables** (CRITICAL)
Add these to your `.env` file in the backend:

```env
# PayU Configuration
PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY=your_payu_merchant_key_here
PAYU_MERCHANT_SALT=your_payu_merchant_salt_here
PAYU_ENVIRONMENT=test  # Use 'test' for sandbox, 'production' for live

# URLs for PayU callbacks
BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.com
```

#### How to Get PayU Credentials:
1. Go to https://www.payumoney.com/
2. Sign up or login to your merchant account
3. Navigate to **Settings → API Configuration**
4. Find your **Merchant Key** and **Merchant Salt**
5. Copy them to `.env`

**For Testing:**
- Use PayU's test credentials from their documentation
- Test gateway URL: `https://sandboxsecure.payu.in/_payment`
- Production URL: `https://secure.payu.in/_payment`

### 2. **Frontend URL Configuration**
Make sure your frontend knows where to redirect after payment:
- Success: `https://your-frontend.com/payment-success?txn=...&amount=...`
- Failure: `https://your-frontend.com/payment-failed?reason=...`

Create these pages if they don't exist or update existing ones to handle these query parameters.

### 3. **Payment Success/Failure Pages**
The PayU callbacks redirect to:
- `/payment-success` - Show confirmation, trigger modal close
- `/payment-failed` - Show error message, allow retry

Example implementation needed:
```typescript
// Pages should:
// 1. Extract query parameters (txn, amount, reason)
// 2. Show user-friendly message
// 3. Handle retry/navigation
```

### 4. **Enable PayU in Payment Settings**
Update the PaymentSettings in admin panel:
- Set `payuEnabled: true` to show PayU tab to users
- This controls whether the UPI/PayU selector appears

## 🔄 Payment Flow

### UPI Flow (Existing - Still Works)
1. User clicks "Preview" → Modal opens
2. Selects UPI tab → Shows QR code
3. Scans QR and transfers money
4. Enters transaction ID manually
5. Server auto-approves payment
6. Badge changes to "Climax Premium"

### PayU Flow (New - Just Added)
1. User clicks "Preview" → Modal opens
2. Selects PayU tab → Shows "Pay with PayU" button
3. Clicks button → Calls `/api/payu/initiate`
4. Backend generates PayU form
5. Frontend auto-submits form → Redirects to PayU gateway
6. User completes payment on PayU
7. PayU redirects to `/api/payu/success`
8. Backend updates payment status to "approved"
9. User redirected to frontend success page
10. Badge changes to "Climax Premium"

## 📋 Testing Checklist

- [ ] PayU credentials added to `.env`
- [ ] Backend server restarted (picks up new env vars)
- [ ] Frontend deployed with updated PaymentModal
- [ ] Click "Preview" on any paid content
- [ ] See UPI and PayU tabs
- [ ] Click PayU tab → "Pay with PayU" button visible
- [ ] Click button → Redirects to PayU gateway (test sandbox)
- [ ] Complete test payment
- [ ] Verify redirect to success page
- [ ] Check MongoDB - Payment record updated with `payuTransactionId`
- [ ] Badge should show "✅ Climax Premium"

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Hash Verification**: All PayU callbacks include hash verification. This prevents tampering.
2. **Transaction IDs**: Each payment gets a unique ID: `{contentId}-{userId}-{timestamp}`
3. **Auto-Approval**: Both UPI and PayU payments auto-approve (status: 'approved')
4. **Payment Method Tracking**: Payment records now track method (upi/payu) and PayU transaction ID

## ⚠️ Known Limitations / Future Improvements

- [ ] Email notifications on payment (optional)
- [ ] Payment history/receipts page
- [ ] Refund handling
- [ ] Multiple payment methods on one account
- [ ] Payment analytics dashboard
- [ ] Subscription/recurring payments

## 📞 Support

If PayU gateway doesn't work:
1. Check that credentials are correct in `.env`
2. Verify backend is restarted after `.env` changes
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Look at backend logs for PayU errors
5. Ensure CORS is allowing PayU domains

## 🔐 Security Checklist

- ✅ Hash verification for PayU callbacks
- ✅ ObjectId validation for MongoDB queries
- ✅ Duplicate payment prevention
- ✅ Transaction ID uniqueness
- ⏳ Rate limiting (if needed, can be added)
- ⏳ Payment amount validation (optional enhancement)
