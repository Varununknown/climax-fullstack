## 🔄 Areas for Iteration

### Priority 1: User Experience Enhancements

#### Issue 1.1: Backend Sleep (Render Free Tier)
**Current State:** Backend goes to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity  
**Impact:** First request after sleep takes 10-30 seconds  
**Solution Options:**
- [ ] Upgrade to Render paid tier ($7/month) for always-on
- [ ] Implement ping system to keep backend warm
- [ ] Add loading spinner/skeleton during cold start
- [ ] Switch to alternative (Railway, Fly.io, etc.)

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium - Acceptable for development, needs fix for production

---

#### Issue 1.2: Payment Success Feedback
**Current State:** Payment completes silently, video resumes  
**Desired State:** Show success toast/notification  
**Implementation Needed:**
```tsx
// Add toast notification on payment success
handlePaymentSuccess = async () => {
  // ... verify payment ...
  toast.success('✅ Payment successful! Enjoying unlimited access');
  // ... resume video ...
}
```

**Priority:** 🟢 Low - Nice to have

---

#### Issue 1.3: Error States & Retry Logic
**Current State:** No error handling for failed payments or API errors  
**Missing:** Retry buttons, error messages, fallback UI  
**To Add:**
- Payment failure modal with retry option
- Network error handling
- Timeout recovery
- Graceful fallbacks

**Priority:** 🔴 High - Needed for production reliability

---

### Priority 2: Content & Streaming

#### Issue 2.1: Video URLs Need Verification
**Current State:** Some content items have broken/YouTube URLs  
**Problem:** Can't stream YouTube links directly  
**Action Needed:**
- Replace YouTube URLs with R2 CDN links
- Test all 9 content items for playback
- Update seed data with working URLs

**Priority:** 🔴 High - Blocks playback testing

---

#### Issue 2.2: Streaming Quality
**Current State:** Quality selector UI exists but doesn't change quality  
**Why:** Requires multiple video bitrates on CDN  
**Options:**
- [ ] Implement HLS streaming with multiple qualities
- [ ] Use video provider API (Cloudinary, Mux, etc.)
- [ ] Keep current single-quality stream (simplest)

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium - UI works, just cosmetic

---

### Priority 3: Authentication & Security

#### Issue 3.1: Google OAuth Integration
**Current State:** Login page exists but needs testing  
**Needs:**
- [ ] Verify Google OAuth keys configured
- [ ] Test login flow end-to-end
- [ ] Confirm user data saves to MongoDB
- [ ] Test logout and session management

**Priority:** 🔴 High - Critical for user management

---

#### Issue 3.2: Payment Verification Webhook
**Current State:** Manual payment check via API  
**Needed for Production:**
- [ ] Implement Razorpay webhook for payment confirmation
- [ ] Add secure signature verification
- [ ] Auto-update payment status on webhook
- [ ] Retry logic for webhook failures

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium - Currently works but not production-grade

---

### Priority 4: Performance & Optimization

#### Issue 4.1: Cold Start Latency
**Current State:** 
- First API call: 10-30 seconds (backend wake-up)
- Subsequent calls: 200-500ms

**Solution:**
- Implement request timeout with fallback
- Show loading state to user
- Preload critical data on app start

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium - Acceptable but can improve

---

#### Issue 4.2: Bundle Size & Code Splitting
**Current State:** Single bundle for all features  
**Opportunity:** Code split by route (admin, user, auth)  
**Impact:** Could reduce initial bundle by 20-30%

**Priority:** 🟢 Low - Works fine, optimization only

---

### Priority 5: Content Management

#### Issue 5.1: Admin Dashboard Features
**Current State:** Admin can add content but limited UI  
**Missing:**
- [ ] Bulk upload capability
- [ ] Drag-drop file upload
- [ ] Preview before publishing
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] User management interface

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium - Nice to have for admins

---

#### Issue 5.2: Content Discovery
**Current State:** Shows all content, no filtering/search  
**Needs:**
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Category filtering
- [ ] Sorting (new, popular, trending)
- [ ] Recommendations

**Priority:** 🟡 Medium - Improves user experience
