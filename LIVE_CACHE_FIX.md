# 🔄 LIVE PLAYER FIX - CACHE CLEAR NEEDED

Your **localhost** shows the correct OLD GOOD PLAYER, but **live** shows the wrong new player.

This is because of **browser cache**. Follow these steps:

## 🧹 **Clear Cache on LIVE URL:**

### **Windows/Linux:**
1. Go to your live URL
2. Press: **`Ctrl + Shift + R`** (hard refresh)
3. Wait 5 seconds
4. Refresh again

### **Mac:**
1. Go to your live URL  
2. Press: **`Cmd + Shift + R`** (hard refresh)

### **Mobile:**
1. **iPhone Safari:** Settings → Safari → Advanced → Website Data → Edit → Remove All
2. **Android Chrome:** Menu → Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Check all → Clear all

## 📱 **If still showing wrong player after cache clear:**

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** or **Storage** tab
3. Clear **All Site Data**
4. Go back and refresh

## ✅ **What's happening:**

- ✅ Your code repo: OLD GOOD PLAYER (commit 5b6ce3d)
- ✅ Your localhost: OLD GOOD PLAYER ✓
- ⏳ Your live: Being redeployed NOW with OLD GOOD PLAYER
- 🔄 Redeploy triggered with empty commit

**Give it 2-3 minutes for Render/Vercel to redeploy, then hard refresh your live URL.**

The old player should be live within minutes! 🎬
