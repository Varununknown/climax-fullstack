# 🔒 Climax Lock Implementation - Complete Fix

**Commit:** 2a2f95e  
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** DEPLOYED ✅

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Problem (Old Behavior)
- ❌ Payment modal appeared but video didn't pause
- ❌ User could still seek/play past climax
- ❌ No visual indicator of locked zone
- ❌ Payment trigger wasn't working correctly

### Solution (New Behavior) ✅
- ✅ Video AUTOMATICALLY PAUSES when reaching climax
- ✅ Can't seek into locked zone (climax → end)
- ✅ Can't play into locked zone
- ✅ "🔒 CLIMAX PREMIUM" badge shows if not paid
- ✅ Locked zone highlighted on progress bar
- ✅ Payment modal triggers immediately on lock
- ✅ After payment, immediate dynamic unlock (no refresh needed)
- ✅ Once paid, never locks again for that content

---

## 📋 Implementation Details

### 1. PRE-PAYMENT CHECK (Before Video Plays)
```tsx
// Checks payment status BEFORE video plays
useEffect(() => {
  const checkPaymentBeforePlay = async () => {
    const res = await API.get(`/payments/check?userId=${user.id}&contentId=${content._id}`);
    setHasPaid(res.data.paid);
  };
  checkPaymentBeforePlay();
}, [content, user]);

// Result: hasPaid = true/false BEFORE anything plays
```

**Why:** Smooth dynamic badge display without manual refresh

---

### 2. LOCKED ZONE DEFINITION
```tsx
// Timeline is split into TWO zones:
const climax = content.climaxTimestamp; // e.g., 30 seconds

// SAFE ZONE: 0s → climax (FREE ACCESS)
// LOCKED ZONE: climax → end (PREMIUM ONLY)

// Example: climax = 30s, duration = 120s
// Safe: 0-30s (30 seconds free preview)
// Locked: 30-120s (90 seconds locked)
```

---

### 3. PREVENT SEEKING INTO LOCKED ZONE
```tsx
const handleSeeking = (e: Event) => {
  const seekTime = video.currentTime;
  
  if (!hasPaid && seekTime >= climax) {
    console.log(`🚫 Seek blocked`);
    video.currentTime = lastValidTime.current; // Rewind
    setShowPaymentModal(true);
    return;
  }
};

video.addEventListener('seeking', handleSeeking);
```

**Behavior:**
- User tries to drag progress bar to 50s
- If climax = 30s AND not paid
- Video rewinds to last safe position (e.g., 29s)
- Payment modal pops up

---

### 4. PREVENT PLAYING INTO LOCKED ZONE
```tsx
const handleTimeUpdate = () => {
  const time = video.currentTime;
  
  if (!hasPaid && time >= climax) {
    console.log(`🔒 Entering locked zone`);
    video.pause();
    video.currentTime = lastValidTime.current;
    setIsPlaying(false);
    setShowPaymentModal(true);
    return;
  }
  
  // Track safe position
  if (time < climax) {
    lastValidTime.current = time;
  }
};

video.addEventListener('timeupdate', handleTimeUpdate);
```

**Behavior:**
- Video plays normally: 0s → 30s (safe)
- At 30.5s (climax passed): PAUSE
- Rewind to 29.5s
- Show payment modal

---

### 5. CLIMAX PREVIEW BADGE
```tsx
const isClimaxLocked = !hasPaid && content.premiumPrice > 0;

// If locked, shows:
{isClimaxLocked && (
  <div className="bg-red-600/90 animate-pulse">
    🔒 CLIMAX PREMIUM
  </div>
)}
```

**Display:**
- Shows in top-right if NOT paid
- Disappears immediately after payment
- Animated pulse to grab attention

---

### 6. PROGRESS BAR LOCKED ZONE INDICATOR
```tsx
// Color gradient shows locked zone:
// - Green: Safe zone (0 to climax)
// - Dark Red: Locked zone (climax to end)

style={{
  background: `linear-gradient(to right, 
    #ef4444 0%,           // Current progress (red)
    #ef4444 ${percentage}%, // Up to current
    #4b5563 ${percentage}%, // Safe zone (gray)
    #4b5563 ${climaxPercentage}%, // Until climax
    #991b1b ${climaxPercentage}%, // Locked zone (dark red)
    #991b1b 100%)`
}}
```

**Visual:**
- Gray bar = free to seek
- Dark red bar = locked zone
- Label "🔒 Locked" shows boundary

---

### 7. DYNAMIC UNLOCK AFTER PAYMENT
```tsx
const handlePaymentSuccess = async () => {
  // Verify from database
  const res = await API.get(`/payments/check?userId=...&contentId=...`);
  
  if (res.data.paid) {
    console.log('✅ Payment verified - full access unlocked!');
    setHasPaid(true); // ← THIS triggers everything dynamically
    setShowPaymentModal(false);
    
    // Resume video
    setTimeout(() => {
      videoRef.current?.play();
      setIsPlaying(true);
    }, 100);
  }
};
```

**What Happens:**
1. Payment submitted
2. Modal closes
3. `setHasPaid(true)` is called
4. All locks are removed (useEffect re-runs with hasPaid=true)
5. Badge disappears
6. Progress bar updates (no dark red anymore)
7. Can seek anywhere
8. Video resumes automatically

**Why No Refresh Needed:**
- React state changes immediately
- All locked logic depends on `hasPaid`
- Changing `hasPaid` updates entire UI dynamically

---

### 8. ONE PAYMENT PER CONTENT
```tsx
// Logic:
// - First time: hasPaid = false → locks at climax
// - User pays
// - hasPaid = true → never locks again
// - Next time video is loaded: payment check returns paid=true
// - Never asks for payment again

// Database tracks:
// Payment collection: { userId, contentId, status: 'approved' }
// One record per user per content = one payment
```

---
